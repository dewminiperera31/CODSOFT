Project Feedback: Landing Page Design (CodSoft Level 1, Task 2)
This landing page project, completed as part of the CodSoft Level 1, Task 2, was an insightful experience in building and styling a website from scratch. The task involved creating a professional, visually appealing landing page using fundamental HTML and CSS skills, which tested my knowledge of layout structuring, responsive design, and creative styling.

LEVEL 1 TASK 2


Creating a landing page, It is an ideal web development project for beginners.

Throughout the project, I focused on several core areas:

Content Organization: I divided the page into clearly defined sections, including the header, hero section, services, about us, and footer, to create a logical and user-friendly layout.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the page looked good on different screen sizes was a priority. I used CSS Flexbox for flexible layouts, allowing the design to adapt smoothly on various devices.
Visual Styling: I experimented with color gradients, padding, and spacing to achieve an appealing design that aligns with current web standards.
Attention to Detail: I carefully adjusted element alignments, padding, and margins to avoid overlapping issues and ensure a cohesive appearance across the page.
Project Management: I approached this project by first planning the structure and identifying the primary sections. Then, I implemented each section one by one, testing and refining each for responsiveness and style consistency. GitHub was used for version control, enabling me to track changes and organize my workflow efficiently.

Completing this task enhanced my understanding of essential web development principles and strengthened my CSS skills, particularly in managing layouts and styling details. This project has been a rewarding part of my CodSoft internship, and I‚Äôm looking forward to applying these skills in future projects.
